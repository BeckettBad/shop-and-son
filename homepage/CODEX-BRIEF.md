# CODEX-BRIEF — &son homepage

Shared hand-off file between **Claude (orchestrator)** and **Codex (coder)**.
Claude writes the **active brief** below from the operator's instruction and
dispatches it to Codex headless (`./dispatch-codex.sh`); Codex implements +
verifies inside `homepage/`; Claude reviews the diff, commits, and logs.

How to read this file:
- **ACTIVE BRIEF** = the one task to do right now. If it says "(none)", wait.
- Scope is always **`homepage/` only**. Don't touch `archive/`, and don't
  casually change root `public/preorders/` (it ships as-is).
- **Edits go LIVE on merge to `main`.** Build on `dev`; the operator verifies and
  approves the merge. Never merge `dev` → `main` yourself.
- Verify with `npm run build` **and** `npx astro check` (both green) before
  declaring done. No mockup comparison — the brief is the spec.
- One focused commit per change.

## Handshake — the automated build loop

Claude drives Codex directly via **headless dispatch** — the operator is NOT a
courier between panes. `./dispatch-codex.sh` runs Codex non-interactively in
`homepage/`, **unsandboxed** (`--dangerously-bypass-approvals-and-sandbox`, the
only way Codex can write `.git`); Codex's stdout returns to Claude. Codex makes
its own focused commit on `dev`; it does **not** push or merge. Pushing `dev` and
opening the `dev → main` deploy PR stay with Claude/operator. The sandbox fence is
off, so the dispatch's scope rules + Claude's review are the only guardrails.

1. **Operator** gives Claude the edit instruction.
2. **Claude** confirms intent + style, writes the ACTIVE BRIEF here
   (`Status: ready for Codex`), then dispatches:
   `./dispatch-codex.sh` (implements the active brief) — or
   `./dispatch-codex.sh "free-form instruction"`.
3. **Codex** (headless) implements in `homepage/` only, runs `npm run build`
   **and** `npx astro check` until both green, makes **one focused commit on
   `dev`** (no push, no merge), and prints the files changed + verify results +
   commit hash to stdout.
4. **Claude** reviews the real commit (`git show <hash>`). If clean → appends a
   **Log** entry (newest at top), sets
   `Status: committed @ <hash> — ready for operator verify`. If Codex was blocked,
   the diff is wrong, or it touched out-of-scope files → Claude amends/reverts and
   fixes the brief, then re-dispatches. Never guess.
   Log shape: `YYYY-MM-DD — <task> — <hash> — build:green check:green — <notes>`
5. **Operator** verifies on `dev` (`npm run dev`).
6. **Ship (PR gate):** when the operator says ship, Claude pushes `dev` and opens
   a PR **`dev → main`** (`gh pr create`) with the diff summary + verify results.
   The operator reviews on GitHub and **merges = deploy** (push to `main` triggers
   the Pages build). Only the operator merges the deploy PR.

## ACTIVE BRIEF

**Status:** ready for Codex
**Task:** Phase F — three fixes after Phase E: (1) FIX the enlarged-expand crowding regression (open subfolder list overlaps the lower headers now that there are 5 sections), (2) remove "ETC..." from & FAM, (3) widen the preorder embed so it fills more of the page (seamless "site within a site").

**Files:** `src/styles/global.css` (expand fix + preorder width), `src/data/content.ts` (& FAM), `src/components/blocks/HeroVideo.astro` (only if needed for the preorder scale var).

**1 — FIX the enlarged-expand crowding (regression).**
- Symptom: with a section open (e.g. OBJECTS), its enlarged subfolder list (SHOP ALL, LIVING, … FURNITURE) sits too close to / overlaps the lower top-level headers (MUSIC, & FAM, PRE-ORDER). Worked with 4 sections; adding the 5th (PRE-ORDER) broke it.
- Cause: in `@media(min-width:761px)` the open `.hero__menu-panel` is `position:absolute; top:clamp(112px,11.5vw,162px); bottom:0` — a FIXED top that assumed 4 headers; with 5 it starts inside the header stack.
- Fix (robust to header count, not a hard-coded bump): drop the absolute positioning and let the open panel sit in NORMAL FLOW directly under its own header (accordion — pushes the lower headers down), still enlarged + left-anchored, with comfortable spacing (~0.5–0.8em above the list, ~0.35–0.5em between items). Remove the `overflow:hidden` the absolute approach put on `.hero__overlay` and let the overlay scroll (`overflow-y:auto`) when a long list (29 designers) exceeds the viewport. Net: every section's subfolder text sits lower with breathing room and never crowds PRE-ORDER. Keep the enlarged sizes (open header ~clamp(20px,2vw,30px), items ~clamp(14px,1.3vw,18px)).

**2 — content.ts:** remove the `"ETC..."` item from the `& FAM` section's items.

**3 — Widen the preorder embed ("site within a site").**
- The preorder panel should fill MORE of the page to the RIGHT than the catalogue does — start it a bit left of the catalogue (`.hero__preorder` left ~30–32vw vs the catalogue's ~36.5vw) and trim outer margins so it spans most of the width to near the right edge, with only a slight background gutter. It should read as a seamless embedded site, NOT an obvious framed box — avoid heavy borders/frames.
- The embed scale auto-derives from panel width ÷ `preorderDesktopWidth`, so a wider panel already enlarges it; if it still reads small, lower `preorderDesktopWidth` toward ~1100–1200. Keep it interactive (scroll/video).

**Keep unchanged:** the catalogue, the stage transition (exit-left/enter-right), the stencil/house animation, all Phase A–E behavior, default landing.

**Done when:** build + `astro check` green; opening any section shows its subfolder list clearly BELOW all 5 headers with breathing room (no crowding of PRE-ORDER), long lists scroll; `& FAM` no longer shows ETC...; the preorder embed fills noticeably more of the page to the right than the catalogue and feels like a seamless site-within-a-site.

### QUEUED (do not start — blocked)

- **Phase C2 — (optional) always-current data.** Real products+images already flow via the BUILD-TIME fetch of `shopandson.com/collections/<handle>/products.json` (refreshes on each deploy). C2 is now only needed if the operator wants products to update WITHOUT a redeploy → switch the data seam to a client-side **Storefront API** fetch (`PUBLIC_SHOPIFY_STORE_DOMAIN` + `PUBLIC_SHOPIFY_STOREFRONT_API_TOKEN`; Storefront API IS CORS-enabled, unlike products.json). Needs the token. Not blocking anything visual now.

### SHIPPED / committed on dev (awaiting operator verify + deploy)
- **Phase A** — hero menu type → 2/3. Committed `a2f93f8`, pushed, in PR #1 (`dev → main`).
- **Phase B** — clean hero video + separate centered stencil overlay layer (`.hero__stencil`). Committed `f4276a8` (assets + HeroVideo.astro + CSS). Claude verified via a composited preview frame. NOT yet pushed (kept off PR #1 until operator verifies).
- **Phase C1** — catalogue interaction + slide animation + mock product grid. Committed `47ded3b`. Claude reviewed clean. NOT yet pushed (kept off PR #1 until operator verifies). C2 (live Shopify) still blocked on token + handles.

## Log (Codex appends newest at top: date — task — result/commit)

- 2026-06-29 — Phase C-rev3: neon-green click feedback + smooth house return on exit — e0c4689 — build:green check:green — --neon-green active states; header-click exits catalogue; returnStencilFromRight() flicker-free right→left glide (transition-off → off-right → reflow → rAF → center). Reviewed clean. Not pushed.
- 2026-06-29 — Phase C-rev2: image lag fix + bigger portrait cards — cf32922 — build:green check:green — CDN width-resize (1.7MB→~120-210KB) via getSizedShopifyImageUrl (cdn.shopify.com only) + srcset 700/1100/1600; catalogue left 42vw→36.5vw, padding/gap cut so 3 cards dominate. Menu-left confirmed in docs. Reviewed clean. Not pushed.
- 2026-06-29 — Phase C-rev fix: resilient build-time fetch — 9a0311f — build:green check:green — getCatalogProducts now try/catches → warn + return [] (deploy can't break on a network blip). Not pushed.
- 2026-06-29 — Phase C-rev: real products+images, full stencil exit, large 3-up cards, scroll-paged rows — 468f53d — build:green check:green — build-time fetch of shopandson.com products.json (clothing 60 + house 27, real CDN images), translateY row-pager (wheel/touch, CSS-var driven), mobile scroll fallback. Reviewed clean (caught + fixed the throw-on-fetch-fail in 9a0311f). Not pushed.
- 2026-06-29 — Phase C1: catalogue interaction + slide animation + mock grid — 47ded3b — build:green check:green — Codex implemented per brief; reviewed clean by Claude (gated on .is-catalog, menu z-index→3, rows of 3, race-guarded render, getCatalogProducts isolates data for C2). Superseded by C-rev. Not pushed.
- 2026-06-29 — Phase B: clean video + separate centered stencil overlay — f4276a8 — build:green check:green — Claude prepped assets (4K→1080p 2.5MB, white stencil IMG_4242→hero-stencil.png); Codex did HeroVideo.astro + CSS; reviewed clean + composite-previewed. Not pushed.
- 2026-06-29 — Codex commit access enabled — `--add-dir` could not lift the seatbelt `.git` block, so per operator's informed choice the dispatch now runs Codex unsandboxed (`--dangerously-bypass-approvals-and-sandbox`); Codex committed this scaffolding itself on `dev`. Commits stay on dev (no push/merge); Claude reviews after.
- 2026-06-29 — shrink hero menu typography (Phase A) — a2f93f8 — build:green check:green — Codex implemented per brief; reviewed clean by Claude (exactly the 4 font-size values, nothing else); Codex sandbox couldn't write repo-root .git, so Claude committed
- 2026-06-29 — shrink hero menu typography — no commit (sandbox blocked `.git/index.lock`) — build:green check:green — CSS implemented; commit step blocked by read-only Git metadata
- (empty)
